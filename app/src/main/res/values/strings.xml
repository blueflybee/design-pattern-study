    <string name="para_zh">   这片沙漠堪称所有沙漠中的完美典型，巨大无比，延及天际，朝任何一个方向望去都无边无际。沙漠白茫茫的，十分刺眼，没有水源，没有生气，惟有隐约闪现的群山的雾霭，只见群山散布在地平线上，那里的鬼草让人做迷梦、噩梦和死亡。偶尔出现的墓碑标记指明了道路，因为穿过厚厚碱层的被覆盖的路径曾经是条公路，客运车和布卡（注：布卡，bucka，一种马车。这是斯蒂芬·金的生造词。斯蒂芬·金在“黑暗塔”生造了大量的词汇表示他虚构世界里的事物。有些生造词的具体涵义令读者琢磨不透，甚至成为不少“黑暗塔”迷热烈讨论的话题。在下文中这种情况还很多。）过去都走这条路。后来，世界滚滚向前。这个世界被腾空了。</string>
    <string name="para_en">  Does one need to begin a diary with background information? This was not a question which crossed my mind when I was eleven—at least not that I recall. And in spite of the great shitload of English courses I’ve taken in my time, I don’t recall ever attending one which covered the Protocol of Journals. Footnotes, synopses, outlines, the proper placement of modifiers, the correct form of the business letter—these were all things in which I took instruction. But on how to start a diary I am as blank as I am, say, on how to continue your life after its light just went out.</string>
